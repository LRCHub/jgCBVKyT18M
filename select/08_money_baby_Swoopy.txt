She picture us together, please no pictures, lady
I'm always in new countries, I'm getting money, baby
They got bottles on the house and it's been so lately
I let the guap do its thing, and we Gucci, baby

Money can't tell what's right or wrong
Formal dinner, still got Fendi on
On a molly, put my brothers on
Bust out a Rollie, not my only one
Gotta watch your step, LEGOs everywhere
Money make you dance, music in my ear
Where is Swoopy? Teachers think I disappeared
Pockets filled, we still gon' bring the bag in here

I'm rich, you're rich, let's have a money baby
New Dsquared jeans every fuckin' day
Money come, money go, throw it all away
Money come, money go, but it's okay
I'ma make it back anyway, I'ma make it back anyway
As long as you say, as long as you say
Just say that you want me too
I'll do whatever you want me to
Money, the Benjamin Franklin is blue
Put Mihara Yasuhiro on my shoes
Got the Wock, got the tris, we could pour up
Me and Swoop getting high on the sofa
Got a show, I get paid just to show up
In the club, we could drink till we throw up

She picture us together, please no pictures, lady
I'm always in new countries, I'm getting money, baby
They got bottles on the house and it's been so lately
I let the guap do it's thing and we Gucci, baby
